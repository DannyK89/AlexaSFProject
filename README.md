# AlexaSFProject

__Basic Project Overview__

Just working on a way to have alexa parse speach into code.
Nothing really speacial about the project.
Just something I wanted to play around with.
The parsing isn't that special.
Looking for key words and turning them into programmic symbols.
Then the system will take the programic statement and create a record in salesforce from it.
